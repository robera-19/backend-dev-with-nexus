what module exist in node?
ChatGPT said:
In Node.js, modules are reusable pieces of code that help you organize functionality into separate files. There are three main categories of modules in Node.js:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Core (Built-in) Modules
These come bundled with Node.js â€” you donâ€™t need to install them.

Module	Description
fs	File system operations (read, write, etc.)
http	Build HTTP servers and clients
https	HTTPS support
url	Parse and manipulate URLs
path	Work with file and directory paths
os	Info about the operating system (CPU, memory, etc.)
crypto	Encryption and decryption
events	Handle custom events (pub/sub style)
stream	Handle streaming data (like file uploads)
buffer	Handle binary data directly
zlib	Compression (gzip, deflate)
util	Utility functions like promisify, inherits, etc.
process	Info about and control over the current Node process
child_process	Run shell commands or spawn subprocesses
readline	Interface for reading input from terminal line-by-line
dns	Perform DNS lookups
net	Create TCP/IPC servers and clients
timers	Timing functions like setTimeout, setInterval (though also available globally)
v8	Access V8 engine internals
worker_threads	For multithreading
ðŸ”¹ 2. Third-party Modules
These are packages from the npm registry. You install them using npm install.

Examples:

express â€“ Web framework

mongoose â€“ MongoDB ODM

axios â€“ HTTP client

lodash â€“ Utility functions

dotenv â€“ Load environment variables

jsonwebtoken â€“ JWT authentication

bcrypt â€“ Hash passwords

ðŸ”¹ 3. User-defined (Custom) Modules
These are files you write and import using require() or import.

// utils/math.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = { add };

// index.js
const { add } = require('./utils/math');
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
ðŸ“Œ Summary
Category	Example	Usage
Core	fs, http	Built into Node
Third-party (npm)	express	Installed with npm install
Custom	./myModule	Your own modules
Let me know if you'd like a cheat sheet or code examples for any module!
